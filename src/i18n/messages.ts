      brandName: "zayna",
      positioning: "Moroccan heritage, clinically-minded clean beauty with cash-on-delivery convenience.",
      story: `zayna is a Morocco-born bio-cosmetics brand that combines local ingredient heritage with modern formulation standards. Our products are developed with measurable performance targets, dermatological safety reviews, and simple usage routines suitable for daily life. We prioritize Moroccan supply chainsâ€”argan, prickly-pear seed oil, rose, and ghassoulâ€”sourced through verified womenâ€™s cooperatives and small producers. This improves traceability and reduces transport miles.\n\nEvery formula follows a clear rule set: no sulfates (SLS/SLES), no parabens, no mineral oil, and fragrance options that respect sensitive skin. Packaging choices are evaluated for recyclability and weight, with ongoing reductions in plastic per unit. We design the user experience for the Moroccan market first: fast load sites, Arabic/French support, and COD nationwide with clear order tracking.\n\nOur approach is practical. Each product lists its key actives and the benefit they targetâ€”hydration, barrier support, frizz control, or gentle cleansing. We release only what we can make consistent, affordable, and available. The result is a compact line that covers core needs, pairs well in simple routines, and is backed by transparent sourcing. zaynaâ€™s goal is to make clean, effective, locally rooted care the default option for customers across Morocco.`,
